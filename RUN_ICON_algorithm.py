'''
Generic version of the RUN-ICON algorithm
developed by Nicholas Christakis and Dimitris Drikakis

Flowchart of algorithm:
A CSV datafile is input
Data is read, saved in a numpy array and normalized, based on the max-min values of each column
Within RUN-ICON, for every loop, the Generalized Centre Coordinate is calculated for comparisons 
Frequency of occurrence of most dominant centres is calculated
Centres are output in a file for future use
PLEASE NOTE: If you want to test frequency of occurrence of dominant centres for different number of clusters 
              you must modify variable "i_cluster" manually in the code

The user is advised to plot the mean value vs the number of clusters with error bars for the maximum

High  mean value correspsonds to Incresed CONfidence (ICON)
